    Include all content items to generate paths for - manually. Simply including Content would require to run this
    include at a *very* specific time, so we'll start slow by just including the items by ourselves.

    Excludes are controlled using the .NET defaults DefaultItemExcludes and DefaultExcludesInProjectFolder, so that
    should work out of the box. But a manual <Content Exclude="..." /> or <Content Remove="..." /> is *not* respected.

    We need to use AdditionalFiles because only those are available inside a source generator.

  <ItemGroup>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="wwwroot/**" SourceItemGroup="Content" Exclude="$(DefaultItemExcludes);$(DefaultExcludesInProjectFolder)"/>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="**/*.razor.js" SourceItemGroup="Content" Exclude="$(DefaultExcludesInProjectFolder)"/>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="**/*.cshtml.js" SourceItemGroup="Content" Exclude="$(DefaultExcludesInProjectFolder)" />
  </ItemGroup>
